When I first got into programming, when I was 14, I felt "this is something special". And programming makes me feel that way till today.

Enjoy building and engineering things. Every day is a new experience. Running on the fuel of "Wow, it works!"

### The technical stuff

- Currently using **JavaScript** for almost everything, from web apps, servers, desktop widgets to making music videos
- Can also write code in a handful other languages
- Experience with a wide range of libraries, tools and technologies, including Firebase, Docker, Chrome Extensions, WebPack, FFMPEG, WebAudio, testing tools, other build tools, databases
- Currently learning **Vue JS**
- UI/UX, PC Hardware are other things I love
- Got a thing for the Web and how Networking works

### What I do

I used to work as a freelance developer, creating automation tools that help people with their boring tasks, and also websites, web apps and mobile apps. Now I work as a developer at Zoho Corp (Chennai). I write and work on personal projects during my free time (sharing the journey on the links below). And I also make EDM.
